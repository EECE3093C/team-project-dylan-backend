### Vision
Our product is a tool for students with an inconsistent income, specifically students on Co-op, to manage their finances throughout college. It will make it easier for students who do internships/Co-ops to keep track of their finances by providing specialized tools for people in these situations. Some of these tools will include out of state taxes calculator, 50/30/20 saving rule calculator, weekly/monthly budget tool, projected semester income calculator, cost of living/average rent calculator, and estimated tax return calculator.
Some of the competitors for this service include Microsoft Excel, NerdWallet, and Quicken
While other finance management services exist, ours will provide a selection of tools that are specifically geared towards students who have inconsistent income and may be working around the country because of various internships/co-ops. 


### Software Architecture
Using our available resources and technology, we have everything we need to build our software. We are going to be using HTML and Python (utilizing the Selenium extension) and do not require any other hardware resources. 
At a high level, the software architecture will be a main webpage with different options of different tools, such as the ones described above, and this webpage will have buttons and boxes that interact with our main Python code. The webpage will act as a client-side server that will communicate with our python code using the Selenium extension. 
Upon each refreshment of the webpage, we will clear the boxes and arrays we have stored. As the user inputs data into the calculator, we will store the necessary data to make the calculations. We will also continue to store the values while they are not changed, to make sure we do not lose any values that can be used elsewhere. These values will include hourly pay, state of employment, months/weeks employed, dates for co-op terms, and more.
As mentioned above, we plan to use HTML and Python for our project. We will also use an extension of Python called Selenium, which is used to interact the Python code with the client-side server. Other than this, we will not need to use any more resources and programming languages. 


### Challenges and Risks
The most serious challenge that we believe we will face when creating this software will be how to divide the work equally between the 5 of us. Another issue which we might run into is which tools to group together in the same program, which tools will be separate features? It will also be difficult to determine what features are able to be completed in the designated time frame. 
In order to mitigate the risk of us missing a deadline, we plan to meet early each week to get a head start on the project. With us getting a head start, if there is more work that still needs to be done, we can meet again later to finish what is needed.
